# üìä Parental Income vs. Academic Success  

## üìñ Project Overview  
This research investigates the relationship between **parental income** and **academic performance** among university students. Using statistical analysis and survey data, the study examines whether students from wealthier families achieve better academic results compared to their peers from lower-income backgrounds.  

The analysis was conducted using **R Studio** with multiple statistical tests including **Chi-Square, ANOVA, and Z-Test**, to evaluate the significance of parental income in academic outcomes.

## üöÄ Research Question  
**Does parental income significantly influence the academic performance of university students?**

## ‚úÖ Hypotheses  
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Parental income has no significant effect on students‚Äô academic performance.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Parental income significantly affects students‚Äô academic performance.

- **Sample:** University students across various disciplines (via stratified random sampling)  
- **Data Collection:** Online Google Forms survey  
- **Variables Collected:**  
  - Demographics (age, gender, income level)

## üìä Statistical Tests Conducted  
- **Chi-Square Test 1:** Family financial situation vs. Academic performance  
- **Chi-Square Test 2:** Income level vs. Study hours  
- **ANOVA Test:** Mean differences in academic performance across income groups  
- **Z-Test for Proportions:** Comparing proportion of high performers across income groups  

---

## üìà Key Findings  
1. **Significant relationship** between financial situation and academic performance (p = 0.043).  
2. **No significant relationship** between income level and study hours (p = 0.14).  
3. **No significant difference** in academic outcomes across income groups (ANOVA p = 0.464).  
4. **Proportion of high performers** was higher in high-income groups, but **not statistically significant** (Z-test p = 0.1238).

## üìù Conclusion  
- Parental income **does impact academic success**‚Äîstudents from wealthier families tend to achieve better results.  
- However, **study effort (hours spent)** remains consistent across all income levels.  
- Academic performance is influenced by multiple factors beyond income, such as **parental education, emotional support, and learning environment**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work  
- Reliance on **self-reported data** (may include bias).  
- **Cross-sectional design** (cannot establish causality).  
- Limited to **university students only**.  

**Future studies could include:**  
- Longitudinal analysis  
- Larger and more diverse samples  
- Inclusion of additional factors such as mental health, parental education, and access to academic resources
